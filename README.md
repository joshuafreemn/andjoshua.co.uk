repo for my portfolio website: www.andjoshua.co.uk

<h3> the website </h3>
  what stared as a simple portofilo to showcase conceptual advertising work,
  has now turned into my first of many websites. #hooked

<h3> the coder </h3>
  so i've just graduated university, with an advertising degree.
  i had a couple bits of work that i wanted to showcase from the degree, hense the need for the website.
  However, since i've started coding i realsied that it's wicked.
  I now have the aim of getting a job in web design/ development before christmas.
