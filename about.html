      <h2>Education History</h2>
      <h3>(BA Hons) Creative Advertising</h3>
      <h3>University of Lincoln (2017 – 2020)</h3>
      <p>
        Recently, I have achieved an upperclass 2:1 within the degree. Amongst my most notable pro-jects during that time was an entry for the D&AD New Blood Awards which received the highest mark in my year. (Said project can be found on the website linked in my contact information.) The consistent stream of weekly briefs set a rapid pace and always demanded a high level of crea-tive competency in execution within only a small time period that averaged a three day turna-round.
        Consequently, I learnt how to produce work that encompassed print, social media, digi-tal, O.O.H and direct mail, to a good standard in a time limited environment. Customer research was an integral part of the degree that forced me to empathise with a target audience to effec-tively communicate a brand message through art direction and copywriting.

      <h3>(BA Hons) Interative Design</h3>
      <h3>University of Lincoln (2016 – 2017)</h3>
      <p>
        This course provided me with great design fundamentals for my current capability. Examples include experimentations with typography and in-depth study in the negative space. The outcome of this was a strong ability in employing visual design into spaces to communicate to a diverse range of audiences.
